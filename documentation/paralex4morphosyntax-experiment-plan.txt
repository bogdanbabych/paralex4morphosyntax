Planning experiments for morphosyntax project

Evaluation of the approach:
	>> success in lemma confirmation for inflected words
	>> success in paradigm generation
	>> coverage of the corpus ???

	generate all word forms (test mode in dict_uk)?
	generate additional word forms in proposed approach >> 
		>> to identify classes of words which have been added
		>> theoretical background: new words in language, the need to maintain the coverage 
		>> dynamic system

	write the motivation
	write theoretical part

Procedure for checking coverage:
	The coverage is checked on the frq word list:
	- 


Insertion of stress = 
	poetry corpus...

Multiword expressions,
TAG
Construction grammar...



Argument:
	compare two corpora: 
		> ukrainian internet corpus 2014 vs. News corpus 2018
		> the degree of overlap ???
		> same size >>

		words with sufficient different frequencies;
		new words >> ??

		answering how much language changes over time 
		// political and other reasons 

		the need:
		>> accounting for the dynamic aspect of morphology... 


		language change argument >> supporting .. / motivation
		problem for highly inflected languages

		coverage of new words ???
		vs. coverage of old words ???

			>> separate statistics....>>> 
			>> motivation for the research >> 



Evaluation ideas:
	1. we can test the approach on the generated list of lemmas --> paradigms should be filled in full, but we will see the amount of noise from the alternations in stem and would be able to capture alternations in a morphosyntactic model.

	2. assess average fill of paradigms from the corpus 
		- for a given corpus -- what is the coverage / fill of paradigms -- how many forms on ave each paradigm contains; what are most frequent forms?


Roadmap:
	implement core algorithm; testing ground -- fiction corpus;
	implement evaluation processes
	start writing the paper

    - implementing paradigm induction
    
    
    
    Example:
        > confirming two paradigms:
        тверді / твердий . твердь
        non-confirming: alternative rejected:
            решт-и / реш-ти (дієслово)

    Question: difference: нести , пекти ? -- same code?
    added benefits:
        guessing sub-class: 
        кредит -- кредита - gen ??? or кредиту???
        
        spurious lexemes found:
            лисому - лисом ??? лисомові ???
            
        errors:
            Ліга, Ліги, Ліг
            -- masc.?? why??? >> threshold in ambiguous forms, not in all possible forms...???

    - stage-by-stage development:
    1. basic functionality output;
    2. writing up -- in the paper;
        >> further experiments if time / space allows...
        
    3. updating according to the lines of further research
    4. ensuring core functionality is ensured first...
    
    
    - order of presentation: sorting returned dictionary?
    
    limitations:

        >> complete overlap of paradigm -- cannot be captured

        syntactic interface for morphological categories:
            - guessing morph category from just one occurrence + syntactic role
        phonological variation and models

        - ambiguous positions merge into one ???
        
        - what to do if several hypotheses match the data?
        - different word forms can give confirmation / rise to different sets of hypotheses, so each should be treated separately...

Our language can be regarded as an ancient city: a maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses, of houses with extensions from various periods, and all this sur- rounded by a multitude of new suburbs with straight and regular streets and uniform houses.
